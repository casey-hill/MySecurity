Integrate existing alarm system into my smart home ecosystem

Integration into an existing security system is doable.  In my situation, I wanted to leverage my existing window and door sensors.  These sensors are all pulled back to an alarm panel in my master closet (must be a standard thing builders do).  My first attemp was to just wire up open/close sensors that were zwave.  These work fine but can be too clostly for most @ $25.00/each.  This is my second attemp to make things cheaper but scale for any size home.

To the devices & Smartthings.

You will need a few things to get this to work.
 1) Smartthings app located here (optional)
 2) Virtual device
 3) Arduino and code
